# About Me

<img src="https://lishangai.github.io//lishangai.jpg" class="floatpic" alt="Shangai Li">

Here is **Shangai Li (Evan, 李尚艾)**.<br>

I am a fourth-year student majoring in Basic Medicine with a minor in Computer Science at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research interests intersect healthcare and technology, focusing on applying computational methods to tackle complex biomedical challenges. I am passionate about using artificial intelligence and data science to enhance healthcare delivery, particularly in personalized medicine. Beyond healthcare, I also have a broad interest in foundational frameworks and other research areas within AI. I plan to pursue a PhD position in Fall 2026 to further my studies and contribute to cutting-edge research in AI-driven healthcare solutions and foundational AI theory.

# About Me

<img src="https://lishangai.github.io/lishangai.jpg" class="floatpic" alt="Shangai Li's profile picture">

Here is **Shangai Li (李尚艾)**.

I am a fourth-year student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, pursuing a major in Basic Medicine and a minor in Computer Science. My core passion lies at the intersection of healthcare and technology, where I focus on applying advanced computational methods to solve complex biomedical problems. I am driven to leverage AI and data science to innovate in personalized medicine and enhance healthcare delivery. My goal is to undertake a Ph.D. starting in Fall 2026, contributing to cutting-edge research in AI-driven healthcare and foundational AI theory.

If you are interested in my work or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me at [lishangai2003@gmail.com](mailto:lishangai2003@gmail.com).
